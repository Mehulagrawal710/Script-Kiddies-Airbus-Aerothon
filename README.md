## Given Problem Statement

To build an innovative solution - ***Konnex*** that integrates the end to end user experience and application support into one single place, which is accessible as an onscreen floating widget on top of any application/webpage, with one single click and looks simple + user friendly, that connects the users with the IT product teams.

## My Solution

- Idea is based on creating a whole community where one user can solve the questions asked by another user for a specific website/application, just like the stackoverflow and quora community.
- This will improve the user experience of a user visiting any website on the internet, because with this application user has the power of community at his disposal, using the very user friendly floating widget I have developed.
- To measure the impact of solution I have introduced gamification feature in the project, which is as defined - whenever a user contributes to the community by answering questions, their score increments. By the scores we can see impact and user engagement.
- Frameworks and tools – Backend is a REST service developed in Spring Boot, User Interface is Floating widget which in turn is a Chrome Extension developed using Javascript & the Console for companies is a website developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap. Databse used is MongoDB. Reason behind choosing Spring Boot is because of its robust design pattern and inbuilt security modules & reason for choosing chrome extension is for the creating the floating effect on top of any website.
- Solution is easily implementable because it is based on a simple but very powerful concept of community. The Idea is scalable to support all websites being a browser extension.

## Ending note
